This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MC
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cloud computing, network infrastructure, and data analytics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analytics/programming
- I have a dog that I enjoy walking.
- I have a Kayak that I enjoy taking out weather permitted.
- I enjoy eating tasty food.
- I recently built a RasPi5 NAS that has multiple functions such as acting as redundant storage, hosting containerized applications, serving up media using plex, and a multitude of other functions I am hoping to implement once I am able to program/code.
